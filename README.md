In order to create the # Weather_Dashboard, I follow this flow.
Initially I created the html file with all the elements required like texareas, buttons and all necessary classes and Ids.
I linked my file with a preexisted framework in bootstrap for design, style and even font.
However, I override the style with a CSS file to improve accesibility.
The data was fetched and parsed with a js file.
the API used was openweathermap.org
